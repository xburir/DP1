First, the space segment is described, including key characteristics of the different satellite types. Then, an overview of the control segment is given, including its operations and evolution of capabilities. This is followed by an overview of the GPS signals, current and future, as well as a description of the navigation data content. Then, the time and coordinate systems used by GPS are described. The chapter is concluded with a brief description of services and performance.},
